# Happy Thoughts

This project was about making our own "twitter-version" by practice React State and fetch and posting data from en API.

## The problem

After watching all of the lectures and done all of the reading for the week I looked at the brief and started to sketch up how the page should look like. I started to write all of the code in App.js and after that I splited up the components in diffrent files, I coded along with the lectures because I thought it was hard to know where to start and where to put which code. We had a design to stick to so it was a bit of a challenge to find the right fonts and colors etc.

If I had more time I would have tried to reach the higher goals for the week, and maybe try to find the more exactly right font.
